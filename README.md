# Christopher Hoover's Blog

Hey, thanks for dropping by. This is the repo for my website, cahoover.com. You can suggest changes or updates via Git.

## Motivation

The emerging standard of web development using JAMstack technologies like React and associated projects like Next.js and Gatsby are fantastic for developers, but would be even more powerful if they also contained marketing-oriented functionality as a fundamental part of the code. Business websites are a marketing tool, after all. 

Examples are central management of site variables (e.g. meta descriptions, title tags, and headlines), built-in AB testing for everything, analytic insights (traffic flow, heatmaps), etc. Does a site really need various third party layers for this functionality?

To help me figure this out, I thought it would be helpful to become reasonably proficient in JAMstack myself. This site is part of that learning, and along the way I figured I'd use it to help other marketers get more proficient in the technical side of their craft.

## Technical

The site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with [Timothy Lin's](https://www.timlrx.com) template as a starting point for learning React/Next. 

It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which is pretty great.
