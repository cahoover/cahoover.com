Thanks for dropping by! I'm the co-founder of AdFury, a platform that automates analysis of online advertising campaigns at scale. I also help companies with lead generation, product positioning, market insights, and branding.

Here I write mostly about marketing, especially as it relates to data science and the psychology of judgment and decision making.
