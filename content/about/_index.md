My first job after college was writing and performing for various comedy groups. After a few years I thought it might be cool to afford stuff, so I came to work in Silicon Valley.

It turns out tech is easier than comedy, and within the first few years I'd written <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Wap-Application-Development-Soo/dp/1930110081/ref=sr_1_2)">a couple coding books</a>. Along the way I became interested in behavioral economics, and ever since I've worked to help companies <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishoover/">better understand and engage with their markets</a>.

I recently co-founded <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/adfury">AdFury</a>, a SaaS platform that helps agencies optimize search advertising campaigns at scale.

That picture is me with my son, who is far and away the best thing that's ever happened to me.
